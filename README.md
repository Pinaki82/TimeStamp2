# TimeStamp2
Vim/GVim plugin to add/update the timestamp. A fork of the original timestamp plugin, created by Peng Du.

Link to the original plugin: https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2159

Put 'timestamp.vim' file directly into the 'plugin' folder or use a plugin manager such as https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.
